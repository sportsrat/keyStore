# keyStore - A redis like key value store

### Overview
Tried to implement a redis like key value store in C++. This server utilizes a single event loop with `epoll` to manage multiple clients at once.  It supports a subset of Redis commands and follows the Redis Serialization Protocol (RESP) for client-server communication. It supports Key Value stores, List Stores and Hash Stores.

### Features
- RESP Parsing
- Non-Blocking I/O : Uses `epoll` for handling multiple connections on a single thread.
- Persists data to disk
- Graceful shutdown with signal handling
